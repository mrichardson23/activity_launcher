# Raspberry Pi Foundation Drop-in Activity Launcher for Events
## Installation
    curl -L http://bit.ly/activity_launcher | bash
This inelegant install script will clone this repo into `~/.activity_launcher`, create a desktop icon, install guizero, create a Thonny preferences directory, and set the counter to zero.
## Configuration
Configuration options are found in `config.ini`
## Event Set up
Below are some rough notes for what I do in order to get this ready for an event:

**Raspberry Pi > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration:**

Disable underscan if needed

Set keyboard to US English

Select Wifi Country if needed

**Connect to Wifi, install activity launcher (instructions above)**

**Raspberry Pi > Preferences > Appearance Settings >**

Desktop tab:

Layout: Center image on sceen

Picture: select `raspberry-pi-logo.png`

Change text color to Raspberry Red: `R 197 G 26 B 74` or `#c51a4a`

Uncheck Wastebasket to hide it from the desktop.

**Raspberry Pi > Preferences > Main Menu Editor**

Uncheck the "show" box next to Games if you wish to hide that

**Open a file browser window:**

Click Edit... Preferences

Under General, check/tick "Don't ask options on launch executable file"

Under Display, update size of large icons to 96 x 96 

**Open the file:** `/home/pi/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE-pi/desktop-items-0.conf`

Update the value for `desktop_font` to `Piboto Bold 18`

**Right click on taskbar launcher icons, click "Application Launch Bar Settings"**

Hide any icons you don't want on the taskbar.
